List of Improvements

(004) integration of redux persist
    - Examine possiblilities how to save redux state (e.g. to local storage etc.)
    - e.g. add persistence because currently all data is lost after a reload
    --> Use Redux Persist: https://blog.logrocket.com/persist-state-redux-persist-redux-toolkit-react/

(005) Implement remove entities in sketcher slice via canvas
    - Select an Entity (e.g. a line, a point) --> press ENTF key to delete it
    (click listener on Entity for selection; then event listener on keyboard - could be combined with drag'n'drop of lines)

(006) Add more tools
   - Radius constraint for circle                           [done]
   - Other constraints: parallel, equal, mid point, ...
   - Arc drawing tool

(007) drag'n'drop of lines and points improvements
   - consider constraints
   - improve behaviour of dragging of lines              [done] --> still improvements possible, but for now enough
   - remove the weirdness of current behaviour           [done]

(008) put common settings in a "settingsSlice" s.t. they can be changed, e.g. color of lines etc.

(009) Improve update of constraints in ConstraintsTable.tsx
   - Current way to edit leaves many ways the user can mess up with the data/ input invalid data
   - Proper error handling needed / edit will be different per constraint type (as display)



(017) Create a tool to generate a rectangle (with proper constraints)


Done Improvements

(001) Improvements of labels drawn on sketch (mainly includes Constraints)
    - Symbols for horizontal, vertical constraint
    - Symbol (number in mm) for length constraint
    + Issue is that when zooming the relative position changes,
      - most likely has to do with current implementation in LineObject.tsx using <Html> object
      - objects are not affected by the zoom operation (have same size and position although size and position of lines change)
    + Need to find alternative way of implementing it (e.g. use dedicated objects which also react to the zooming)

(002) update of constraints on canvas (e.g. makes sense for length constraint)
    - implement (001) first to have dedicated objects which can be selected (respond to click events)

(003) delete of constraints on canvas
    - implement (001) first to have dedicated objects which can be selected (respond to click events)

(010) Highlight of selected items (constraints, entities) - in table as well as on canvas
   - For entities it is already implemented one way
       Select in table --> Highlight on canvas
   - TODO entities: Select on canvas --> Highlight in table
   - Same for constraints

(012) Add support for circle in solver backend - seems to be not supported yet (fully constrained although no radius constraint)

(014) Selection of point to point constraints (length constraints) for lines is not yet supported --> the implementation should be reworked

(013) Selection of entities constraint: deselection is not yet supported

(011) Fix bug when deleting entities:
   - It is possible to delete an endpoint of a line without deleting the line --> app crashes because one endpoint of line cannot be found

(015) Drag'n'drop of circles --> update of circle radius

(016) Bug when adding coincident constraints to multiple overlapping points: e.g. two circle mid points and zero point 
      - a coincidence constraint is added for each point resulting in duplicated constraints --> constraint error
      --> multiple constraints are added (which are redundant)
