For saving/ restoring the redux persist state the Firefox extension LocalStorage Editor shall be used:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/localstorage-editor/

# Export
Just press the "Download" button in the extension to download the local storage data in a json file.

# Import
- Open the file to import and copy all its content to clickboard (CTRL+A followed by CTRL+C)
  (Direct import via file system seems not to be exported)
- In the LocalStorage Editor view delete the existing local storage by using "Delete" button
- Press the "Import" button to load the data from the clipboard
- Important: Press the "Submit" button to apply the changes to local storage.
             Without this step nothing gets changed in local storage.
