List of Improvements

(B001) Basic main view with camera control --> MainView.tsx

(B002) Integration of Sketcher tool 
    - create new sketch                 // done
    - update existing one -> set active one to the selected sketch and open Sketcher tool
    - navigation between Sketcher and 3dMod tools

(B003) List with sketches and geometries

(B004) Datamodel update sketchSlice.ts --> Document with sketches and geometry

(B005) Mapping of sketches to 3D View (and basic workflow)
    - All closed lines should be interpreted as faces
    - On each face (or multiple) an Extrude is possible to create a 3D object
    --> see B007

(B007) Display Sketch in 3D View
    - All closed surfaces shall be individually selectable --> to apply an operation (like extrude)
    - Workflow: 
       1) Create Sketch
       2) Go back to 3D Modeller and Sketch is disabled
       3) Select one/ multiple faces an apply operation (e.g. Extrude --> give a length)
       4) 3D Body is created
    - A history of these operations shall be stored (e.g. also to go back and forth in time)


Done Improvements

(B006) Integration of opencascade.js / @bitbybit-dev/occt-worker
    - Currently there are massive performance issues with initOpenCascade() function (to be tested on different machines)
    - Also when switching to the Sketcher View immediately performance is still impacted
       - in this case need to find a way to stop initOpenCascade() function
    - Docu says that "You can then host this asset using infinite caching duration headers"
       https://ocjs.org/docs/getting-started/configure-bundler
       - How to do that?
    - Check out if one of these should be used instead: 
       https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitbybit-dev/occt-worker      // --> go for this since it is for the browser (uses a web worker)
